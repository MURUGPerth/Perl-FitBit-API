NAME

FitbitClient - OO Perl API used to fetch fitness data from fitbit.com

SYNOPSIS

Sample Usage:

    use FitbitClient;
    
    my $fb = new FitbitClient(
        # Available from fitbit profile URL
        user_id => "XXXNSD",
        # Populated by cookie
        sid     => "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX",
        uid     => "12345",
        uis     => "XXX%3D"
    );
    
    OR
    
    my $fb = new FitbitClient(config => 'conf/fitbit.conf');
    
    # No date defaults to today
    my @log = $fb->get_calories_log();
    foreach (@log) {
        print "time = $_->{time} : calories = $_->{value}\n";
    }
    
    print "calories = " . $fb->total_calories("2010-05-03") . "\n";
    print "activescore = " . $fb->total_active_score("2010-05-03") . "\n";
    print "steps = " . $fb->total_steps("2010-05-03") . "\n";

DESCRIPTION

FitbitClient provides an OO API for fetching fitness data from fitbit.com. Currently there is no official API, however data is retrieved using XML feeds that populate the flash-based charts.

Intraday (5min and 1min intervals) logs are provide for:

 - calories burned
 - activity score
 - steps taken
 - sleep activity (every 1 min)

Historical (aggregate) info is provided for:

 - calories burned / consumed
 - activity score
 - steps taken
 - distance travels (miles)
 - sleep (total time in hours, and times awoken)

METHODS

See method comments for detailed API info:

Note that all detailed log methods (get_*) and historical (total_*) accept a single data parameter (format = YYYY-MM-DD). If no date is supplied, today's date will be used.

EXAMPLE CODE

See test_client.pl and dump_csv.pl

KNOWN_ISSUES

At this time, if you attempt to tally the intraday (5min) logs for the total daily number, this number will NOT match the number from the total_*_ API call. This is due to the way that FitBit feeds 
the intraday values via XML to the flash-graph chart. All numbers are whole numbers, and this rounding issue causes the detailed log tally to be between 10-100 points higher.

For example:

    # Calling total = 2122
    print "Total calories burned = " . $fb->total_calories()->{burned} . "\n";
   
    # Tallying total from log entries = 2157
    my $total = 0;
    $total += $_->{value} foreach ( $fb->get_calories_log($date) );
